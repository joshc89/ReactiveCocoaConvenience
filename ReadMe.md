## Installation

ReactiveCocoaConvenience is [Carthage] compatible. Add

	github "joshc89/ReactiveCocoaConvenience"

and following the [Carthage] installation instructions.

As there is no official [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) support for ReactiveCocoa, Cocoapods is not officially supported for ReactiveCocoaConvenience either.
